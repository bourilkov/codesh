    The tests subdirectory contains a test suite for automatic
testing of the basic functionality of codesh with a Subversion
backend. Passing all tests is a precondition for making new
releases public. The tests serve a dual purpose as examples of
using codesh.

    Initialize codesh as customary and go to the tests subdir (we
recommend to run the tests ONLY in this place).

    Two ways to run the tests:

      1) At the shell prompt

        ./testSuiteSvn.txt

      2) Using codesh (in this mode a master codesh process is used
         recursively in batch mode to invoke codesh many times for the
         different tests)

        codesh.py -c codesh.bash.conf -b < testSuiteSvn.txt

        OR

        codesh.py -c codesh.tcsh.conf -b < testSuiteSvn.txt

    Each test will report its status at the end of the run.

    List of tests:

    Basic tests of the backend (virtual logbooks)

     Illustrates basic codesh commands to log/reuse sessions

      16:  Subversion repository: if you forget to set it
      17:  Subversion repository with bash: log and browse
      18:  Subversion repository with tcsh: log and browse
      19:  Subversion repository with bash: extract bash/tcsh sessions
      20:  Subversion repository with tcsh: extract bash/tcsh sessions

     Illustrates basic codesh commands to log/reuse subdirectories

      23:  Subversion repository with bash: take snapshot of subdirectory
      24:  Subversion repository with bash: get snapshot of subdirectory
