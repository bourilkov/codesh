    The tests subdirectory contains a test suite for automatic
testing of the basic functionality of codesh. Passing all tests
is a precondition for making new releases public. The tests
serve a dual purpose as examples of using codesh.

    Initialize codesh as customary and go to the tests subdir (we
recommend to run the tests ONLY in this place).

    Two ways to run the tests:

      1) At the shell prompt

        ./testSuite.txt

      2) Using codesh (in this mode a master codesh process is used
         recursively in batch mode to invoke codesh many times for the
         different tests)

        codesh.py -c codesh.bash.conf -b < testSuite.txt

        OR

        codesh.py -c codesh.tcsh.conf -b < testSuite.txt

    Each test will report its status at the end of the run.

    List of tests:

    Basic tests of the frontend (user interface)

     Shell functionality

      04:  Aliases with bash
      05:  Use of eval with tcsh
      06:  Use of eval with bash

    Basic tests of the backend (virtual logbooks)

     Illustrates basic codesh commands to log/reuse sessions
