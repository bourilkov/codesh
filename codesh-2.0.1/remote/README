For Subversion and CVS servers we provide sample install scripts.
The scripts in the "remote" directory may require running as root.
Two scripts are available:

   servsvn.py
   servcvs.py

Extreme caution is necessary. Always make a new directory and
only run them there. Never run them in a place where you keep
your files.

If you install CVS pserver, first make a backup of:

   /etc/services    file
   /etc/xinetd.d    directory

The ASCII server requires UNIX accounts on the remote server. If you
do not particularly like the idea of managing UNIX accounts, consider
using Subversion or CVS servers.

On the other hand, if you have an existing server where your users
already have accounts and can ssh/scp, or you will be the sole remote
user of the repository, the ASCII server is very easy to set up.

The documentation for different servers is in the files:

   Doc_ASCII_Server.txt
   Doc_CVS_Pserver.txt
   Doc_Subversion_Server.txt
