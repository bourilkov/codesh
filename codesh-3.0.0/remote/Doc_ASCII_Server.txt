The set up of an ASCII server is very simple.

1> Create an ASCII repository on the server using the standard script

create-codeshasciirepository.sh

2> Give UNIX accounts to all remote users and install their public SSH keys.

3> Make all users members of a common group and change the file permissions
   on the repository to read/write for this group.

If you do not particularly like the idea of managing UNIX accounts, consider
using Subversion or CVS servers.

On the other hand, if you have an existing server where your users
already have accounts and can ssh/scp, or you will be the sole remote
user of the repository, the ASCII server is very easy to set up.
Actually, there is no process running on the host, ssh or scp are
invoked on demand when the users initiate interactions with the
repository.
