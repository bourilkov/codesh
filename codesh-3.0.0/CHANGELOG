Initial version codesh-0.6.2

Changes in codesh-0.6.3

   Improved:
     - handling of shell commands in the background (for bash)
     - cd command
     - checks if a valid (existing) configuration file is given

Changes in codesh-0.6.4                   05-Dec-2006

   The interactive response to user commands has been improved:
try e.g. top or emacs &.

Changes in codesh-0.7.0                   23-May-2007

   CODESH core hardened.
   Robust and flexible handling of different classes of shell
commands.
   Alias handling improved, especially in bash.
   stderr output included in the log files.
   Repository commands protected if the user has not initialized
the repository location.
   Tested on different platforms with tcsh and bash.
   Requires python2.

Changes in codesh-0.8.0                   11-Jun-2007

   Introducing a new persistent backend for virtual sessions,
based just on flat (mostly ASCII) files, and corresponding
new module codeshbascii.py. Now the user has a clear choice
between: a CVS backend; a flat file (ASCII) backend, thus
avoiding the CVS dependency; or no backend at all.
   The protection of repository commands has been improved. Now
they are executed only after a check that the repository specified
by the user is alive and operational. The verification of
user-supplied command line parameters has been improved.

Changes in codesh-0.8.1                   04-Oct-2007

   Introducing a new and expandable test suite for automatic testing of
the basic functionality of CODESH. Passing all tests is a precondition for
making new releases public. The tests serve a dual purpose as examples of
using CODESH in different modes of operation.
   The protection of CODESH commands when using tags with the ASCII 
backend has been improved. Non-existent tags are detected automatically
and feedback is provided to the user.

Changes in codesh-0.8.2                   06-Oct-2007

   The case when bash is the underlying shell and there are no pre-defined
user aliases is handled properly, thus avoiding warning messages.
   The test suite is made more robust by eliminating a dependency on
the user setting of the PATH environment variable for tests 05 and 06.

Changes in codesh-0.9.0                   15-Oct-2007

   This version introduces access to remote repositories for the ASCII
persistent backend for virtual sessions, based on ssh and scp. Access
to remote hosts can be controlled e.g. by the use of public and private
keys. The standard create-codeshasciirepository.sh script can be used
to create repositories on remote hosts.
   The test suite is expanded to check the functionality of the
takesnapshot and getsnapshot commands.

Changes in codesh-1.0.0                   14-Dec-2007

   This version introduces a new persistent backend for virtual sessions,
based on Subversion, and corresponding new module codeshbsvn.py. Now the user
has an expanded choice between: a Subversion backend; a CVS backend; a flat
file (ASCII) backend, thus avoiding Subversion or CVS dependencies; or no
backend at all. The standard create-codeshsvnrepository.sh script can be used
to create repositories on local or remote hosts. Access to remote svnserve
repositories can be svn user based (no user shell accounts on server) or over
SSH.

Changes in codesh-1.0.1                   17-Dec-2007

   This version introduces a new testsuite for automatic testing of the new
persistent backend for virtual sessions, based on Subversion - testSuiteSvn.txt
located in the tests subdirectory. The users can run tests for an expanded
choice of options: a Subversion backend; a CVS backend; a flat file (ASCII)
backend, thus avoiding Subversion or CVS dependencies; or no backend at all.
The tests serve a dual purpose as examples of using CODESH in different modes
of operation.

Changes in codesh-1.1.0                   29-Apr-2008

   This version introduces the option to automatically track and store in the
persistent backends files with extensions from a tracked list defined by the
users. Up to now users had the option to automatically track and store
executed (typically source code) files like shell/python/perl scripts, placed
as the first word on the command line, or sourced files (e.g. ". myfile.sh"
in bash or "source myfile.csh" in tcsh), and to store other files needed to
reproduce a virtual session by explicitly using the record command. Now this
can be done automatically for all files with extensions from the user defined
tracked list, located anywhere on the command line. A typical example is a
shell script taking files as input parameters and depending on their
existence to execute successfully.

Changes in codesh-1.2.0                   02-May-2008

   This release introduces the novel concept of a flex session. The convenient
log-and-replay mechanism of CODESH is expanded to log-modify-and-replay. Now
individuals and groups can not only log, share and reproduce their sessions at
will, they can browse and inspect sessions from private or shared repositories,
alter them on the fly from the command line or files containing the changes,
and "replay" many similar sessions starting from a previously recorded session.
The modified sessions can in turn be recorded for further use and reuse.

Changes in codesh-1.2.1                   23-May-2008

   This version improves the user interface for handling tags. Now users can
supply on the command line not only full tag names, but shorter substrings
as long as they are unique. In case of ambiguities, a list of matching tags
to chose from is returned. The taking of snapshots is improved: the user is
asked before taking a snapshot if it exceeds 2048 kB, and the possibility
to enter an infinite loop if the repository is located below the snapshot
directory is avoided.

Changes in codesh-1.2.2                   18-June-2008

   This version takes full advantage of the improved user interface for
handling tags. The test suite is simplified substantially and made more
elegant by using the new feature of supplying on the command line not only
full tag names, but shorter substrings as long as they are unique.

Changes in codesh-1.3.0                   21-June-2008

   This version improves the user experience by hardening both the frontend
and the Subversion, CVS and ASCII backends. The checks on the user input
are extended and now the users are warned basically in all situations if
they try to run commands with wrong number of parameters. The verifications if
the backend repositories are up and running when the users try to access
them are extended with dynamic checks, approaching complete coverage.

Changes in codesh-1.4.0                   30-June-2008

   The focus of this version are the distributed computing (remote) aspects
of CODESH. A new subdirectory "remote" is introduced. It contains sample 
scripts showing how to set up remote (client/server based) Subversion, CVS
and ASCII backends, along with detailed documentation. The scripts can be used
not only to set up CODESH backends, but general purpose remote Subversion or
CVS pserver repositories as well. As customary, extreme caution and studying
the documentation in advance is recommended before setting up servers.

Changes in codesh-1.4.1                   10-July-2008

   The test suite is streamlined to produce shorter and more focused output,
making it easier to scan the results from each test. The code for the various
backends is cleaned up and a problem when extracting flex sessions (the
log-modify-and-replay mechanism of CODESH) from remote CVS backends is fixed.

Changes in codesh-2.0.0                   11-March-2010

   Starting point for a new development cycle. The web server hosting codesh
is migrated to new hardware.

Changes in codesh-2.0.1                   24-July-2013

   Deprecated code like os.popen and string exceptions brought to Python 2.6
standards. Corresponding warnings disappear.

Changes in codesh-2.0.2                   12-April-2019

   Improved the test suite for svn (specifically test19.txt) to reduce
warnings.

Changes in codesh-2.0.3                   12-July-2019

   Improved the svn backend (codeshbsvn.py) to eliminate warnings (no
bugs, but why inconvenience the users).

Changes in codesh-3.0.0                   10-July-2019

   This version uses Python 3. All Python code transitioned 2->3.
