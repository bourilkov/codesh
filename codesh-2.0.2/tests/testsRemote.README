    The tests subdirectory contains a test suite for automatic
testing of the basic functionality of codesh with the different
backends. Passing all tests is a precondition for making new
releases public. The tests serve a dual purpose as examples of
using codesh.

    Initialize codesh as customary and go to the tests subdir (we
recommend to run the tests ONLY in this place).

    To run the remote tests:

      1) Create a file

          remoterepo.file

         containing the locations of the remote ASCII, CVS and SVN
         repositories, e.g.

user@hostname:/codesh/RepositoryASCII
:pserver:user@hostname:2401/codesh/RepositoryCVS
svn://user@hostname:3690/

         and login to each of them in advance to avoid login prompts
         during the tests.

      2) At the shell prompt
 
        ./remotetestSuite.txt
        ./remotetestSuiteSvn.txt

    If you repeat the tests, use newly created fresh repositories as we
do not provide clean-up yet.
